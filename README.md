# STEPS:

## STEP 1:
Create the boilerplate React app via
"npx create-react-app portfolio-tracker"

## STEP 2:
change name of public -> index.html to Crypto Kings

## STEP 3
delete boiler plate React App.js and preloaded styles in App.css and render basic Hello World

## STEP 4
Wrap App.js in BrowserRouter and import it.

## STEP 5 :
Create Components (Header), and Pages (CoinPage and HomePage);

## STEP 6 : 
setup Styles in MaterialUI (create classname, provide styles inside of it, create an object for classes, and provide it to the classname)

## STEP 7 :
Header (app bar) : style and render with select drop down component, and wrap the header in the ThemeProvider dark mode.

## STEP 8 :
Setup Context API (file in Pages) to set the state at the beginning. We'll use context API also in the Crypto Context.

## STEP 9 :
Import our State

## STEP 10 : 
Create Crypto context provider and wrap the whole app in in it, and make sure the state changes for all the currency toggling.

## STEP 11 :
Homepage bulding. divided in 2 parts :

## APP MUST :
User React for front end - [x]
Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server - []
Use MongoDB and Mongoose ODm for Database - []
Use Queries and Mutations for CRUD - []
Be Deployed on Heroku - []
Include Authentication (JWT) - []

## ADD-ON :
Add STRIPE to take donations - []

## ISUES FACED:
- commentary : I was trying to leave as many comments as possible, but turns out that that can lead to a tonne of warnings. So I had to remove some of them. I'll try to add as many as possible.

## LEARNINGS:
- Shortcuts : the RAFCE shortcut via the ES7 extension in VSCode creates the boilerplate for a functional component.
- Material UI : I learnt how to use Material UI, and how to use the basic table, and the select drop down component.
- CTRL + space : to see the options available for the component (and import automatically)
- use `git config --global alias.tree '! git ls-tree --full-name --name-only -t -r HEAD | sed -e "s/[^-][^\/]*\//   |/g" -e "s/|\([^ ]\)/|-- \1/"'` to see the tree structure of the project, and call it by `git tree`
